Three point one four one five nine, this is Pi
Followed by two-six-five-three-five-eight-nine
Circumference over diameter
Seven-nine, then three-two-three
O-M-G, can't you see?
Eight-four-six-two-six-four-three
And now we're on a spree
Thirty-eight and thirty-two, now we're blue
Oh, who knew?
Seven thousand nine hundred, fifty and then a two
Eighty-eight and forty-one, so much fun
Now a run
Nine-seven-one-six-nine-three-nine-nine
Three-seven-fifty-one
Half way done
0-five-eight, now don't be late
Two-0-nine, where's the wine?
Seven-four, it's on the floor
Then nine-four-four-five-nine
Two-three-0, we gotta go
Seven-eight, we can't wait
One-six-four-0-six-two-eight
We're almost near the end, keep going
Sixty-two, we're getting through
0-eight-nine-nine, on time
Eight-six-two-eight-0-three-four
There's only a few more
Eight-two, then five-three
Fourty-two, eleven, seven-0 and sixty-seven
We're done, was that fun?
Learning random digits
